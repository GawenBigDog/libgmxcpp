Example Programs
================

There is an example program in the ``example`` directory. Use ``make`` to compile it
and test it out on an .xtc and .ndx file from a recent simulation.

Additionally `there is an example program which calculates the radial
distribution function using this library <https://github.com/wesbarnett/rdf>`_.
