 * The following "bootstrap" functions split up a set of data ("data") into
 * several blocks. These blocks are randomly chosen with replacement. The
 * values corresponding with these blocks are then calculated. For these
 * calculations the data is a value averaged over the entirety of a simulation.
 * The new values are calculated boot_n times and stored into a vector. Then the
 * variance of these new values are calculated. The square root of that is the
 * uncertainty. The first of these functions is for a set of data (so a
 * two-dimensional vector). The second function is for a single value.
