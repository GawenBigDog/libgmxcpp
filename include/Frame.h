 * coordinates and box for that time/step. rvec and matrix types come 
 * from the xdrfile library. rvec is actually a float matrix with three
 * elements. It is pointer here so that later it will be initialized
 * as an array containing the coordinates of all of the atoms of the frame.
 * The matrix type is just a 3 x 3 array. Frame objects are usually not created
 * on their own, but instead are created as a vector in a Trajectory object.
